# GCAdapter_To_Xbox_Linux
This software comes with no warranty.

Instructions:
sudo ./LaunchThis.sh

I really have no idea how licenses work, but this program installs and runs xboxdrv(http://pingus.seul.org/~grumbel/xboxdrv/), a GPL v3 program. It also installs and runs Toadking's wii-u-gc-adapter(https://github.com/ToadKing/wii-u-gc-adapter), which uses the MIT license. Do not redistribute unless your code complies with both licenses.
